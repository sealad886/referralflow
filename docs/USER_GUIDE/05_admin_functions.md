# User Guide: Admin Functions

This guide is for users with **Manager** or **Admin** roles. These functions are accessible from the "Admin" section at the bottom of the sidebar.

### User Management (Managers & Admins)

The **User Management** page allows you to add, edit, and manage all user accounts in the system.

-   **Add a User**: Click the "Add User" button.
-   **Edit a User**: Click on any user's row to open the edit dialog.
-   **In the Edit Dialog, you can**:
    -   Update a user's personal and contact information.
    -   Change their assigned **Role** (e.g., Clinical, Manager).
    -   Set their **Status** (e.g., Active, Inactive).
    -   Assign them to **User Groups**.
    -   Set specific **Permission Overrides** that apply only to that user.

### Location Management (Admins Only)

The **Locations** page allows Administrators to manage the hierarchy of facilities and departments and configure their settings.

-   **Organizational Structure**: View and edit the hierarchy of locations. Click on any location to navigate to its settings page.
-   **Add a Location**: Use the "Add New Location" button to create a new facility or department.
-   **Settings Inheritance**: Settings applied to a parent location (like a hospital) are automatically inherited by its children (like departments). You can override these settings at any level.
-   **Settings Simulator**: On the main Locations page, select a location from the dropdown to see a simulation of which settings are being inherited and which have been explicitly overridden. This is useful for verifying your configuration.
