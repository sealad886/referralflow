# User Guide: The Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see after logging in. It provides a high-level overview of your referral activity and highlights items that need your attention.

### Key Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find four key metrics about your referrals:

- **Ongoing Referrals**: The total number of referrals that are currently in progress and not yet completed.
- **Completed This Month**: The number of referrals you have successfully completed in the current calendar month.
- **Avg. Time to Complete**: The average number of days it takes for a referral to go from creation to completion.
- **Requires Action**: The number of referrals assigned to you that are in a "Pending" state and require your review.

### Requires Action

This section lists the most critical tasks and referrals that need your immediate attention. Items are color-coded by priority:

- **Red**: Critical tasks, such as STAT referrals awaiting acceptance.
- **Yellow**: Important alerts, like referrals that have had no updates for a set period.
- **Blue**: General reminders.

### My Referral Updates

This feed shows the most recent activity on referrals you are involved with. It's a quick way to see status changes, new notes, and completions without having to search for each referral individually.

Unread updates are marked with a blue background to draw your attention.
