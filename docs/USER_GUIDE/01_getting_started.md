### Main Interface Overview

Once you log in, you will be taken to the main **Dashboard**. The interface is divided into two main sections:

1.  **Sidebar (Left)**: This is your primary navigation tool. It contains links to all the major sections of the application you have access to.
2.  **Main Content Area (Center)**: This is where you will view and interact with the information from the section you selected in the sidebar.

### The Sidebar

The sidebar provides access to all the core features:

- **Dashboard**: An overview of your referral activity.
- **Referrals**: A complete list of all patient referrals.
- **Patients**: A searchable database of all patients.

For users with **Manager** or **Admin** roles, you will also see an "Admin" section at the bottom of the sidebar with links to:

- **Users**: Manage user accounts and permissions.
- **Locations**: Manage facilities and departments.

### Your User Account Menu

Clicking on your name and avatar at the bottom of the sidebar will open your account menu. From here, you can:

- **Access Settings**: Change your profile information and application appearance.
- **View Notification Log**: See a history of all notifications sent by the system.
- **Log Out**: Securely log out of the application.

If you see a **red dot** on your avatar, it means you have new, unread notifications.
