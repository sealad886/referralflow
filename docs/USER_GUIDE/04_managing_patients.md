The Patient Record dialog contains two main sections:

1.  **Demographic Information**: This section at the top displays the patient's ID (MRN), name, date of birth, and gender.
2.  **Referral History**: This table lists all historical and ongoing referrals for the patient, showing the date, department, status, and diagnosis for each.

### Editing Patient Information

1.  From the **Patient Record** dialog, toggle the **Edit Mode** switch at the top right.
2.  You can now edit the patient's name, date of birth, and gender.
3.  Click **Save Changes** to save your updates.

### Viewing a Patient's Full Audit History

From the **Patient Record** dialog, click the **See Full History** button at the bottom. This will take you to a dedicated page showing a complete audit log for that patient, including every time their record was viewed or edited, and by whom.
